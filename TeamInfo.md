## Project Summary

The application we are planning on creating is a trivia game that allows users to start trivia games whenever they want, they can choose their game length and buzz in whenever they want to answer the question. The trivia question that will be shown to the user and will slowly reveal more of itself as the timer decreases. Once the timer is finished, the question will be fully revealed and the user will have additional time to answer the question. Buzzing in early will net them more points which will be stored into a database with score information. 
Additionally, there will be a component to our project that allows users to interact with each other. Users will be able to see the high scores of other users in a leaderboard.
